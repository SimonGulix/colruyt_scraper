# colruyt_scraper
Not really a scraper, but uses the hidden API of www.colruyt.be in order to scrape their products.
Written in Python.
Not optimized, I didn't spend a lot of time thinking because I needed it very fast and only need it once.

It uses concurrent.futures in order to speed up the process. 
It also automatically scrapes proxy's and uses them in the request.
